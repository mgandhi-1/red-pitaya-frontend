Instructions for Compiling and running custom code on Red Pitaya

1. Send the C code from computer to board. 

// scp /path/to/custom/c/api/ root@rp-xxxxxx.local:/root

2. Connect to the board over ssh (replace the IP, default password: root)

// ssh root@192.168.0.100

3. To prevent specifying path to C api script everytime, creake a Makefile script in the same folder as the APis to link the libraries during the compilation process. 

4. Applications based on the API require a specific FPGA image to be loaded
